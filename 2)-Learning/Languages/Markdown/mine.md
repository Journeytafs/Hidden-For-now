### Markdown Flavors, otherwise know as Supersets.

Supersets of Markdown include basic syntax and build upon it by adding additional elements like tables, code blocks, syntax highlighting, URL auto-linking, and footnotes. Many of the most popular Markdown applications use one of the following lightweight markup languages:

[CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/)
[GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
[Markdown Extra](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/)

Best Practices:
So far best practices are, to learn the specialized bits of markdown, and start writing it, using a universal style, that is supported by most markdown flavors.
and add sections, to improve, depending on what markdown tyou will be working on. So Write general markdown, with room and notes to improve depending on future markdown enviroemtn.
Seperate diffrences at flavors, so you kinda know, what you will be dealing with. Perfer asterisk or lines and equal signs throughoiutthe decoment.
