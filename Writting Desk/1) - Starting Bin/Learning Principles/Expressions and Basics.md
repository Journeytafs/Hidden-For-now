Expression in VS Code
Expressions toggle enables regex searching or matching specific patterns (like wildcards or advanced search rules). In web dev, expressions often refer to:
Regex Patterns: Find and manipulate strings.
Logical Expressions: Code structures that evaluate true/false (e.g., if conditions).
CSS Expressions: Calculations in stylesheets (deprecated but historical knowledge helps).
Other “Get Gos” to Weave In
Priority on Terminology: Like “toggle,” “expression,” “DOM,” etc.
System Setup Guides: Creating dev environments smoothly (VS Code, GitHub, Anki setup).
Skill Maps: Which foundational knowledge builds upon others.
Frameworks: Like Pareto Principle (80/20) for efficiency.
