Learning Techniques to Master
Active Recall: Test yourself frequently, focusing on retrieval.
Spaced Repetition: Use Anki or similar tools to reinforce over time.
Feynman Technique: Learn by explaining concepts in simple terms.
Chunking: Break information into manageable, logical pieces.
Deliberate Practice: Focus on improving weak areas with intention.
Mind Mapping: Visualize and connect ideas (Notion works wonders for this).
Interleaving: Mix related topics to strengthen overall understanding.
Pomodoro Technique: Work in focused sprints (25 minutes on, 5 minutes off).
Reflection: Recap what you’ve learned; adjust and improve your approach.
Flow State Optimization: Eliminate distractions and immerse fully.
Expression in VS Code
Expressions toggle enables regex searching or matching specific patterns (like wildcards or advanced search rules). In web dev, expressions often refer to:
Regex Patterns: Find and manipulate strings.
Logical Expressions: Code structures that evaluate true/false (e.g., if conditions).
CSS Expressions: Calculations in stylesheets (deprecated but historical knowledge helps).
Other “Get Gos” to Weave In
Priority on Terminology: Like “toggle,” “expression,” “DOM,” etc.
System Setup Guides: Creating dev environments smoothly (VS Code, GitHub, Anki setup).
Skill Maps: Which foundational knowledge builds upon others.
Frameworks: Like Pareto Principle (80/20) for efficiency.
