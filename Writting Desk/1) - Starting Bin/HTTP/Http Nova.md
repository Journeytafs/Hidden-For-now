1. HTTP and Requests: First Steps or Advanced?
First Steps: Learning HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) and requests is foundational. It’s like learning the "rules of the road" before driving—these are the basics of how the internet communicates.
What is HTTP?
HTTP is the protocol browsers, apps, and APIs use to send and receive information. Imagine you're sending letters back and forth, and HTTP defines how those letters are formatted and delivered.

Requests and Methods in HTTP:
GET: “Send me this data.” Example: Loading a webpage or fetching user info.
POST: “Here’s some new data.” Example: Submitting a form or creating a new account.
PUT: “Update this data.” Example: Changing your profile details.
DELETE: “Remove this data.” Example: Deleting a comment.
Why it’s Crucial for White Hats:
Understanding Traffic: White Hats need to analyze HTTP requests to find vulnerabilities like unsecured endpoints or misconfigurations.
Web App Testing: Tools like Burp Suite or Postman rely on HTTP knowledge to simulate or test web traffic.
APIs and Automation: Writing scripts for penetration testing or automating tasks requires comfort with HTTP requests.
So yes, learning HTTP and requests is a must-have first step for White Hats.

HTTP for Dummies
Let’s dive into:

What is HTTP? HyperText Transfer Protocol – the foundation of communication on the web. Think of it as the language between browsers and servers.
Core Components:
Request Methods: GET (fetch data), POST (send data), PUT (update data), DELETE (remove data).
Status Codes: 200 (success), 404 (not found), 500 (server error).
Headers: Metadata about requests and responses (e.g., Content-Type, Authorization).
Structure: A request has a method, URL, headers, and body.
Keep it light but practical – maybe add one HTTP request example using a REST API.

What is HTTP?

Stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol.
A communication protocol for transferring web data.
Follows a client-server model: Your browser (client) requests, and the server delivers.
How It Works:

Request: Browser sends an HTTP request to a web server.
Response: Server sends back requested data (HTML, images, etc.).
Stateless: Each request is independent; the server doesn’t remember past interactions.
Key Features:

HTTP Methods:
GET: Retrieve data.
POST: Send data to the server.
PUT & DELETE: Modify or delete resources.
Status Codes:
200: OK.
404: Not Found.
500: Server Error.
Next Steps for HTTP Learning
Key Point 1.1: Deep dive into HTTP requests and headers.
Point 2: Explore HTTPS (HTTP + encryption via SSL/TLS).
Point 3: Understand HTTP vs. WebSocket for real-time communication.
