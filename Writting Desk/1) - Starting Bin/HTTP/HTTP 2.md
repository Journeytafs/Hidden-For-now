HTTP: Authentication Basics
Source: Basic Access Authentication (Wikipedia)

Overview:

HTTP Basic Authentication is a simple challenge-response mechanism for securing web pages.
Uses a username and password encoded in Base64, passed through the HTTP header.
Weaknesses:

Plaintext transmission of credentials unless encrypted by HTTPS.
Vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks if HTTPS isnâ€™t implemented.
Practical Applications:

Useful for minimalistic systems or low-risk internal networks.
Often paired with HTTPS for added security.
