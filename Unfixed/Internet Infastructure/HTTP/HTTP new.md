Got it! Diving into HTTP Protocol: Everything You Need to Know from SoftUni. Here’s a sharp summary for you:

HTTP Overview
Definition:

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the backbone of data communication for the web.
Stateless and request-response based.
Core Concepts:

Request Methods:
GET: Retrieve resources.
POST: Submit data to a server.
PUT: Update existing resources.
DELETE: Remove resources.
Status Codes:
Informational (1xx): Request received, processing continues.
Success (2xx): Request successfully processed.
Redirection (3xx): Further action needed.
Client Errors (4xx): Issues with the request.
Server Errors (5xx): Server-side problems.
Statelessness:

Each HTTP request is independent, meaning the server doesn’t retain session data between requests.
Solution: Cookies, sessions, and tokens.
Headers:

Request Headers: Provide details like content types or authentication.
Response Headers: Share metadata about the server or the returned resource.
Secure HTTP (HTTPS):

Adds encryption using SSL/TLS, ensuring secure data transfer.
Evolution:

HTTP/1.1: Persistent connections and caching mechanisms.
HTTP/2: Faster, multiplexed streams for better performance.
HTTP/3: UDP-based, minimizing latency and improving speed.
Key Applications in White Hat Path
Interception: Tools like Wireshark and Burp Suite rely on understanding HTTP to analyze and debug traffic.
Vulnerability Testing: Knowing HTTP basics is critical to spotting flaws like improper authentication handling or unprotected endpoints.
This should bolster your HTTP knowledge base! I’ve also made it lean and practical for your white hat endeavors. Let me know if there’s more to tweak or dive into!
