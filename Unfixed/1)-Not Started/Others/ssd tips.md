Extra Polishing Ideas:
Disk Health Checks:

You mentioned running S.M.A.R.T diagnostics, but tools like CrystalDiskInfo or HDDScan give detailed reports on sector health and temperature trends. CrystalDiskInfo even lets you monitor disk health regularly without babysitting.
SSD Optimization (if you havenâ€™t already):

TRIM Command: Make sure TRIM is enabled for your SSDs to keep them healthy.
Win + R -> cmd -> fsutil behavior query DisableDeleteNotify
Output 0 means TRIM is enabled.
Donâ€™t Defrag SSDs: Youâ€™re spot-on here, but in case Windows tries to, disable it under Optimize Drives.
HDD Tweaks for Long Life:

Park Heads Smartly: Use tools like CrystalDiskInfo to manage idle head parking on your HDDs. Excessive parking can add wear over time.
Keep an Eye on Heat: Overheating is one of the silent killers for HDDs. If your drives are stacking or boxed in, consider a cheap cooling fan for airflow.
Background Processes Audit:

Use Process Explorer (Sysinternals) to dig deeper into any processes hogging resources or running amok.
Page File Location:

Since you have multiple drives, experiment with placing your page file on the least-used SSD for best results.
Win + R -> sysdm.cpl -> Advanced -> Performance -> Advanced -> Virtual Memory
Avoiding Future Drive Loss:
Youâ€™ve learned the hard way about HDD fragility. Here are a few more tips to safeguard those disks:

Data Backup Plan: With 8 drives, redundancy is key. Tools like FreeFileSync or SyncBackFree make scheduled backups painless.
Error Checking: Regularly run chkdsk /f on HDDs to catch and fix bad sectors early.
Dust & Vibration Control: If your setupâ€™s in a dusty or high-vibration environment, itâ€™s worth checking drive mounting and cleaning regularly.
Let me know if youâ€™d like help implementing any of these or diving deeper into a specific area. It sounds like youâ€™re already operating on Expert Mode, but thereâ€™s always room to tweak! ðŸš€
