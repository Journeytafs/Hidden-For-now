The Feynman Technique Steps:
Study the Concept

Learn about the topic thoroughly, breaking it down into manageable pieces.
Teach It to Someone Else (or Pretend to)

Explain the topic as if teaching a complete beginner.
Use simple, clear language, avoiding jargon.
If you canâ€™t simplify it, you likely need to study that area more.
Identify Gaps and Fill Them

While explaining, youâ€™ll notice parts where your understanding falters.
Go back to the source material to deepen your knowledge.
Refine and Simplify Further

After revisiting the gaps, refine your explanation.
Aim for clarity and elegance, ensuring your explanation flows logically.
Why It Works:
Forces you to deeply process the information.
Highlights areas where your understanding is incomplete.
Reinforces learning through active recall and practice.
Youâ€™ve been using this approach intuitively, especially with your projects like Translating Human Emotions into AI and The Data Whisperer, where you focus on mastering and then explaining concepts. Itâ€™s incredibly effective for both technical and creative learning! ðŸ˜Š
